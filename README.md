List of Produced Files for Dissemination:

The presentation exhibited for Milestone 2 at Curtin University on 17/04/2024: Deriving Knowledge from Attribute Labels for Data Quality Assessment.pptx

The Appendices associated with this paper: Attribute-Based Semantic Type Detection and Data Quality Assessment.pdf, which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14692 and is going to be presented at BDCAT 2024, the 11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies.

•	The updated codes of the two main programs, 'Attribute-BasedSemanticType Detection.ipynb' and 'Attribute-BasedDataQualityAssessment.ipynb'; 

•	The updated dictionaries that form the base of the Semantic Type Detection, 'formats_dictionary.txt' and 'abbreviations_dictionary.txt';  The 2 full dictionaries of this step of the research are available if you are willing to collaborate with the research. Please contact me at marcelovalentimsilva@gmail.com or marcelo.valentim@bcb.gov.br.

•	The source files for the two Semantic Type Detection analysis: 'TenDatasets.xlsx' and 'FortyDatasets.xlsx', which contain the data for the two sets of datasets, and the 'AllColumnsFromTenDatasets.xlsx' and 'AllColumnsFromFortyDatasets.xlsx' which contain all the required data for the Data Quality Assessment of the fifty datasets with their column names/attribute labels as well as their descriptions. 'Fiftydatasets.xlsx' has the two spreadsheets combined.

•	The output of the 'Attribute-BasedSemanticTypeDetection.ipynb' code, the 'AnalysedColumns.xlsx' file which contains the full Semantic Type Detection result, including the proposed format and word considered for all 922 columns in the fifty datasets.

•	Then the 'Attribute-BasedDataQualityAssessment' code used the 'TenDatasets.xlsx' and 'FortyDatasets.xlsx' files as well as the 'AnalysedColumns.xlsx'  and each one of the fifty datasets' content files, obtained on the internet, so that all content could be verified against the formats previously suggested in the 'Attribute-BasedSemanticType Detection'. 

•	For each set of datasets, a collection with all the outputs produced from each execution of a single dataset, created two documents with all discoveries: 'Discoveries on the ten datasets.pdf'  and 'Discoveries on the forty datasets.pdf'. These documents were enhanced with Alert analyses obtained from executions of ‘YData Profiling’ in all fifty datasets.

•	Lastly, a spreadsheet titled 'SummaryofDiscoveries.xlsx' was created and it contains two sheets obtained from the Discoveries documents: One with Data Quality Issues (DQIs) found with Created errors, so that the functions could be tested, and one centred on the Data Issues, so that it becomes easy to see the 77 ‘?’ that were found in the 106 different Data Quality Issues.
